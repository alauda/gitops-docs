# Integrating Code Repositories via Argo CD dashboard

Use the native Argo CD dashboard to integrate code repositories and allocate repositories, enabling developer to manage GitOps applications throughout their entire lifecycle via a visual interface.

## Use Cases

- Simplify the creation process of **GitOps Applications** by selecting the associated repository via the web console when creating them.
- When creating an **Application** via the native Argo CD dashboard, you can choose to use the associated repository.

## Prerequisites

- [Installing Alauda Container Platform GitOps](../install_gitops/install_gitops_plugin.mdx), and the **Native Argo CD UI** switch has been enabled.
- Access to the **Native Argo CD UI** URL along with username and password. 
   - The Administrators can directly access the URL through the GitOps cluster plugin details page.

## Procedure

Follow these steps to utilize the features:

1. Connect Code Repository

   - Log in to **Argo CD** using the access URL.

   - Click on **Settings** in the left navigation bar.

   - Click on the **REPO** card.

   - Click **CONNECT REPO** in the upper left corner of the page.

   - Choose the method to connect the repository and fill in the corresponding parameters as needed.

   - Click **CONNECT**.

2. Associate Project

   - Click on **Settings** in the left navigation bar.

   - Click on the **Projects** card.

   - Click on the project where you need to create the GitOps application.

   Note: Argo CD will automatically sync projects in the cluster, so there is no need to create them manually.

   - Click **EDIT** in the **SOURCE REPOSITORIES** section.

   - Click **ADD SOURCE**, enter the repository URL from the **Connect Repository** step, and associate it with the project.

   - Click **SAVE**.

## Operation Result

- Return to the web console and navigate to **Container Platform** > **GitOps Applications**. On the **Create** page, you will see the associated repositories.
