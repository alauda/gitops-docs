# Troubleshooting

## I've deleted/corrupted my repo and can't delete my app?

Argo CD can't delete an app if it cannot generate manifests. You need to either:

1. Reinstate/fix your repo.
2. Delete the app using `--cascade=false` and then manually deleting the resources.

## Why is my application still `OutOfSync` immediately after a successful Sync?

See [Diffing Documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/diff-strategies/) for reasons resources can be OutOfSync, and ways to configure Argo CD to ignore fields when differences are expected.

## Why is my application stuck in `Progressing` state?

Argo CD provides health for several standard Kubernetes types. The `Ingress`, `StatefulSet` and `SealedSecret` types have known issues which might cause health check to return `Progressing` state instead of `Healthy`.

- `Ingress` is considered healthy if status.loadBalancer.ingress list is non-empty, with at least one value for `hostname` or `IP`. Some ingress controllers (contour , traefik) don't update `status.loadBalancer.ingress` field which causes `Ingress` to stuck in `Progressing` state forever.

- `StatefulSet` is considered healthy if value of `status.updatedReplicas` field matches to `spec.replicas` field. Due to Kubernetes bug [kubernetes#68573](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/68573) the status.updatedReplicas is not populated. So unless you run Kubernetes version which include the fix [kubernetes#67570](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67570) StatefulSet might stay in Progressing state.

- Your `StatefulSet` or `DaemonSet` is using `OnDelete` instead of `RollingUpdate` strategy.
- For `SealedSecret`, see [Why are resources of type `SealedSecret` stuck in the `Progressing` state?](#sealedsecret)

As workaround Argo CD allows providing [health check](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/health/) customization which overrides default behavior.

If you are using Traefik for your Ingress, you can update the Traefik config to publish the loadBalancer IP using [publishedservice](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/#publishedservice), which will resolve this issue.

```yaml
providers:
  kubernetesIngress:
    publishedService:
      enabled: true
```

## How to disable admin user?

Add `admin.enabled: "false"` in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap.

## Argo CD cannot deploy Helm Chart based applications without internet access, how can I solve it?

Argo CD might fail to generate Helm chart manifests if the chart has dependencies located in external repositories. To solve the problem you need to make sure that `requirements.yaml` uses only internally available Helm repositories. Even if the chart uses only dependencies from internal repos Helm might decide to refresh `stable` repo. As workaround override `stable` repo URL in `argocd-cm`config map:

```yaml
data:
  repositories: |
    - type: helm
      url: http://<internal-helm-repo-host>:8080
      name: stable
```

## After creating my Helm application with Argo CD I cannot see it with helm ls and other Helm commands?

When deploying a Helm application Argo CD is using Helm only as a template mechanism. It runs `helm template` and then deploys the resulting manifests on the cluster instead of doing `helm install`. This means that you cannot use any Helm command to view/verify the application. It is fully managed by Argo CD. Note that Argo CD supports natively some capabilities that you might miss in Helm (such as the history and rollback commands).

This decision was made so that Argo CD is neutral to all manifest generators.

## I've configured cluster secret but it does not show up in CLI/UI, how do I fix it?

Check if the cluster secret has the label `argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: cluster`. If the secret has the label but the cluster is still not visible, it may be a permission issue. Try listing the clusters using the `admin` user (e.g.: `argocd login --username admin && argocd cluster list`).

Check if cluster secret has `argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: cluster` label. If secret has the label but the cluster is still not visible then make sure it might be a permission issue. Try to list clusters using `admin` user (e.g. `argocd login --username admin && argocd cluster list`).

## Why Is My App Out Of Sync Even After Syncing?

In some cases, the tool you use may conflict with Argo CD by adding the `app.kubernetes.io/instance` label. E.g. using Kustomize common labels feature.

Argo CD automatically sets the `app.kubernetes.io/instance` label and uses it to determine which resources form the app. If the tool does this too, this causes confusion. You can change this label by setting the application.instanceLabelKey value in the `argocd-cm`. We recommend that you use `argocd.argoproj.io/instance`.

:::info
When you make this change your applications will become out of sync and will need re-syncing.

## How often does Argo CD check for changes to my Git or Helm repository?

The default polling interval is 3 minutes (180 seconds) with a configurable jitter. You can change the setting by updating the `timeout.reconciliation` value and the `timeout.reconciliation.jitter` in the `argocd-cm` config map. If there are any Git changes, Argo CD will only update applications with the `auto-sync` setting enabled. If you set it to 0 then Argo CD will stop polling Git repositories automatically and you can only use alternative methods such as `webhooks` and/or `manual syncs` for creating applications.

## How Do I Fix invalid cookie, longer than max length 4093?

Argo CD uses a JWT as the auth token. You likely are part of many groups and have gone over the 4KB limit which is set for cookies. You can get the list of groups by opening "developer tools -> network":

1. Click login to the Argo CD dashboard [How to Obtain Argo CD Access Information](./how_to/argocd_info.mdx)
2. Find the call to `<argocd_instance>/auth/callback?code=<random_string>`

Decode the token at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). That will provide the list of teams that you can remove yourself from.

## Why Am I Getting rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing When Using The CLI?

Maybe you're behind a proxy that does not support HTTP 2? Try the `--grpc-web` flag:

```bash
argocd ... --grpc-web
```

## Why are resources of type SealedSecret stuck in the Progressing state? \{#sealedsecret}

The controller of the `SealedSecret` resource may expose the status condition on resource it provisioned. Since version `v2.0.0` Argo CD picks up that status condition to derive a health status for the `SealedSecret`.

Versions before `v0.15.0` of the `SealedSecret` controller are affected by an issue regarding this status conditions updates, which is why this feature is disabled by default in these versions. Status condition updates may be enabled by starting the `SealedSecret` controller with the `--update-status` command line parameter or by setting the `SEALED_SECRETS_UPDATE_STATUS` environment variable.

To disable Argo CD from checking the status condition on `SealedSecret` resources, add the following resource customization in your `argocd-cm` ConfigMap via `resource.customizations.health.<group_kind>` key.

```yaml
resource.customizations.health.bitnami.com_SealedSecret: |
  hs = {}
  hs.status = "Healthy"
  hs.message = "Controller doesn't report resource status"
  return hs
```

## How to rotate Redis keys?

- Delete `argocd-redis` secret in the namespace where Argo CD is installed.

  ```bash
  kubectl delete secret argocd-redis -n <argocd namesapce>
  ```

- If you are running Redis in HA mode, restart Redis in HA.

  ```bash
  kubectl rollout restart deployment argocd-redis-ha-haproxy
  kubectl rollout restart statefulset argocd-redis-ha-server
  ```

- If you are running Redis in non-HA mode, restart Redis.

  ```bash
  kubectl rollout restart deployment argocd-redis
  ```

- Restart other components.

  ```bash
  kubectl rollout restart deployment argocd-server argocd-repo-server
  kubectl rollout restart statefulset argocd-application-controller
  ```

### How do I fix Manifest generation error (cached)?

`Manifest generation error (cached)` means that there was an error when generating manifests and that the error message has been cached to avoid runaway retries.

Doing a hard refresh (ignoring the cached error) can overcome transient issues. But if there's an ongoing reason manifest generation is failing, a hard refresh will not help.

Instead, try searching the repo-server logs for the app name in order to identify the error that is causing manifest generation to fail.
