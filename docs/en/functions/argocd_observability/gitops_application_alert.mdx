The web console's **GitOps Applications** management capabilities enable viewing **GitOps Applications** monitoring, logs, and events. You can also create alerting policies for **GitOps Applications**. When anomalies occur in **GitOps Applications**, proactive alert notifications will be triggered to facilitate rapid issue identification, analysis, and resolution.

## Prerequisites

- A GitOps application has been created on the web console. [Creating an Argo CD Application via the web console](../../how_to/create_gitops_app.mdx)
- [Installation of Monitoring Plugins](/observability/monitor/install_monitor.mdx)

## Alert

> Create alerting rule in advance to configure rules. When GitOps applications encounter anomalies, proactive notifications will be triggered to enable quick issue identification, analysis, and resolution.
