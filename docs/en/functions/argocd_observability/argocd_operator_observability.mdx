# Argo CD Component Monitoring

## Overview

The monitoring dashboard of the web console offers a visual approach to monitor Argo CD components. It proactively observes the resources and operational states of Argo CD components, aiming to ensure their healthiness and availability. Here, the operational states refer to the running conditions and performance metrics of the components in the Kubernetes (K8s) environment. By closely tracking these aspects, we can promptly detect and address any potential issues, maintaining the smooth operation of Argo CD within the K8s cluster.

## Prerequisites
