# Introduction
Argo CD is a very popular open-source GitOps tool. To use Argo CD, you need to understand the following core concepts: 

1. Application: A group of Kubernetes resources as defined by a manifest. This is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD). [Application](./concept_argocd_application.mdx)
2. ApplicationSet: A Kubernetes controller supporting the ApplicationSet CRD, enabling bulk generation of Applications from a single template. Think of it as an Application factory that creates instances based on parameters. [ApplicationSet](./concept_argocd_applicationset.mdx)
3. Tool: Specifies the configuration management tool for Application sources (e.g., Kustomize, Helm). [Tool](./concept_argocd_tool.mdx)
4. Sync: The process of reconciling an application's live state with its desired state (e.g., applying changes to Kubernetes clusters). [Sync](./concept_argocd_sync.mdx)
5. Health: Indicates an application's operational status, including readiness and ability to serve requests. [Health](./concept_argocd_health.mdx)

## Summary of Differences Between Application and ApplicationSet

| **Attribute**       | **Application**            | **ApplicationSet**                                    |
| :------------------ | :------------------------  | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition          | Single application deployment | Template for generating multiple Application instances. |
| Configuration       | Static YAML definitions       | Dynamic parameter-driven template generation |
| Deployment          |  Single application           | Multiple similar applications  |
| Use Cases            | Simple single-environment deployments | Complex multi-environment/cluster deployments requiring parameterized instances|
| Core Concepts       | Git Repo, target cluster, deployment strategies | Generators, templates, parameters, placeholders |
| Role in Argo CD.    | Fundamental deployment unit  | Advanced bulk management layer |

## Argo CD Sync Statuses

| **Sync Status**      | **Description**                                                 |
| :------------------  | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Synced**          | Application's live state fully matches desired state. |
| **OutOfSync**       | Live state diverges from desired state; synchronization required. |
| **Syncing**         | Active synchronization in progress; live state converging to desired state.  |
