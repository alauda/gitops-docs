# Tool

## Introduction

**Tool** refers to a utility used to generate or process Kubernetes resource `Manifests`.

## Supported Tools

Argo CD supports several Kubernetes manifest definition approaches:

- **Kustomize Applications** [Kustomize](./concept_argocd_tool_kustomize.mdx)
- **Helm Charts** [Helm](./concept_argocd_tool_helm.mdx)
- **Directory**: Manifests containing `YAML`/`JSON`/`Jsonnet` files, including `Jsonnet` [Directory](./concept_argocd_tool_directory.mdx)
- **Custom Configuration Management Plugins**: Any custom tool configured as a Config Management Plugin

## Development Workflow
Argo CD allows direct upload of local `manifests`, but this is intended **for development purposes only**. Overriding requires users with permissions (typically administrators) to upload local `manifests`. It supports all aforementioned Kubernetes deployment tools. To upload a local application:

```bash
argocd app sync APPNAME --local /path/to/dir/
```

## Feature Comparison

| **Feature**      | **Helm**         | **Kustomize**      | **Directory (Pure YAML)** |
| :--------------- | :--------------- |:------------------ | :------------------------ |
| **Configuration Method**|Templating (dynamic generation)| Declarative (patches and overlays) |Static YAML files|
| **Reusability**| High (via Charts) | Medium (via base/overlay) | Low |
| **Multi-Environment Support**| High (via values.yaml) |High (via overlays)| Low |
| **Progressive Delivery**| High (complex logic support) | Medium (simple patch support) | Low |
| **Learning Curve**| High (template syntax) | Low (YAML-based) | Low |
| **Argo CD Integration** | Supported | Native Support  | Supported |
| **Use Cases**| Complex apps, multi-environment, distribution |  Multi-environment, config reuse | Small projects, rapid prototyping |
