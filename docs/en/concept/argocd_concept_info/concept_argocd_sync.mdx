# Sync

## Sync Overview

Sync is the core functionality of Argo CD, responsible for comparing the **Desired State** of an application with its **Live State** and taking actions to reconcile discrepancies. 
In essence, Sync ensures that the state of applications in your Kubernetes cluster aligns with the state defined in the Git repository.  
You can trigger Sync manually or configure Argo CD to perform it automatically. Auto-Sync can be triggered by monitoring Git repository changes (e.g., commits, tag pushes) or executed at scheduled intervals. 

## Sync Status Overview

Sync Status indicates the synchronization state of an application, reflecting whether its **Live State** matches the **Desired State**. Sync Status includes the following states: 
- `Synced`: The application's **Live State** exactly matches the **Desired State**.  
- `OutOfSync`: The application's **Live State** diverges from the **Desired State**.  
- `Syncing`: The application is undergoing synchronization, with the **Live State** converging toward the **Desired State**.  

## Sync operation status Overview
Sync Operation Status represents the execution state of a synchronization operation by Argo CD, indicating whether the operation completed successfully. Sync operation status includes the following states:
- `Succeeded`: The synchronization operation completed successfully.  
- `Failed`: The synchronization operation failed due to reasons such as Kubernetes resource conflicts, insufficient permissions, etc.  
- `Running`: The synchronization operation is in progress.  

## Refresh Overview

This operation fetches the latest application configuration from the Git repository and compares it against the actual state in the Kubernetes cluster. Refresh can be triggered manually or configured for automatic execution at defined intervals.
