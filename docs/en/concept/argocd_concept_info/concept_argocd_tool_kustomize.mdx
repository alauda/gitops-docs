# Kustomize

## Introduction

Kustomize is a Kubernetes-native configuration management tool that enables users to customize Kubernetes resource definitions (YAML files) through overlays and composition without directly modifying original files.

## Core Concepts of Kustomize

- **Base**: Base configurations containing common Kubernetes resource definitions.  
- **Overlay**: Customization layers that modify Base configurations.  
- **kustomization.yaml**: A configuration file defining how resources are composed and modified. 

Argo CD's integration with Kustomize enhances GitOps practices by enabling declarative continuous delivery. Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: kustomize-example
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    path: examples/helloWorld
    repoURL: 'https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize'
    targetRevision: HEAD
  destination:
    namespace: default
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
```

If a `kustomization.yaml` file exists at the `repoURL` and `path` location, Argo CD will render manifests using Kustomize.

Kustomize supports the following configuration options:

- `namePrefix`: Prefix appended to Kustomize-generated resource names.
- `nameSuffix`: Suffix appended to Kustomize-generated resource names.
- `images`: List of Kustomize image overrides.
- `replicas`: List of Kustomize replica overrides.
- `commonLabels`: Map of labels added to all resources.
- `labelWithoutSelector`: Boolean defining whether common labels should apply to resource selectors and templates.
- `forceCommonLabels`: Boolean allowing override of existing labels.
- `commonAnnotations`: Map of annotations added to all resources.
- `namespace`: Kubernetes resource namespace.
- `forceCommonAnnotations`: Boolean allowing override of existing annotations.
- `commonAnnotationsEnvsubst`: Boolean enabling environment variable substitution in annotation values.
- `patches`: List of Kustomize patches supporting inline updates.
- `components`: List of Kustomize components.

To use Kustomize with overlays, point your path to the overlay directory.

## Advantages

- Declarative Configuration: Uses YAML files (via kustomization.yaml) to define resource composition and modifications.

- Template-Free: Customizes configurations through patches and overlays without template engines.

- Kubernetes-Native Integration: Kustomize is built into kubectl, requiring no additional tools.

## Use Cases

- Multi-Environment Distribution: Achieve environment-specific configurations (e.g., apps, clusters) via Base and Overlay.

- Configuration Reuse: Ideal for reusing base configurations across projects.

- Progressive Delivery: Gradually adjust resource configurations through patches.
