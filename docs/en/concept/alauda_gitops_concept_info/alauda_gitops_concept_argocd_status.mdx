# Alauda Container Platform GitOps Sync and Health Status

Alauda Container Platform GitOps abstracts the state of `Application` resources by leveraging the status of underlying Kubernetes resources. The state of `Application` resources directly governs the state of associated `ApplicationSet` resources.  

## Sync Status Explanation 

Both Kubernetes resources and applications have four sync states: **Sync Failed**, **OutOfSync**, **Syncing**, and **Synced**.  

| **Sync Status**  | **Description**                                 |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Sync Failed** | Synchronization failed due to network errors, configuration issues, or permissions problems. Check logs for root cause. |
| **OutOfSync** | Cluster resource state diverges from Git-defined desired state. Manual/auto sync required. |
| **Syncing** | Active reconciliation in progress between cluster state and Git-defined state. |
| **Synced** | Cluster resource state matches Git-defined desired state. |

:::info
**Sync Status Display Priority**: Priority order **Sync Failed** > **OutOfSync** > **Syncing** > **Synced**.

**Examples**:  
- If an Application has two resources with **Syncing** and **Synced** statuses, its overall status is **Syncing**.    
- If an ApplicationSet manages two Applications with **Sync Failed** and **Synced** statuses, its overall status is **Sync Failed**.

## Health Status Explanation

Kubernetes resources and applications have six health states: **Unknown**, **Missing**, **Degraded**, **Paused**, **Progressing**, and **Healthy**.  

| **Health Status** | **Description**  | **Reference Solution**   |
|:----------------- |:---------------- |:------------------------ |
| **Unknown**   | Unable to determine health state, typically due to controller errors or missing status data.  | Inspect resource YAML's `status.conditions` for diagnostic details. |
| **Missing**   | Resource not found in cluster. | Initial creation: Wait for reconciliation <br/> Accidental deletion: Trigger manual sync. |
| **Degraded**   | Workload resources (e.g., Deployment) failed to achieve healthy state within timeout period (default: 10 mins). | Investigate Pod failures (e.g., crashes, resource constraints). |
| **Paused**   | Workload resources rollout intentionally paused (e.g., via <code>kubectl rollout pause</code>). | Resume rollout if appropriate.|
| **Processing** | Resource created successfully but not fully ready (e.g., Pods initializing). | Monitor until transition to Healthy/Degraded. |
| **Healthy**   | Resource operating normally.   | - |

:::info
**Health Status Priority**:Priority order **Unknown** > **Missing** > **Degraded** > **Paused** > **Progressing** > **Healthy**  

**Examples**:  
- If an Application has resources with **Healthy** and **Unknown** statuses, its overall health is **Unknown**.  
- If an ApplicationSet manages Applications with **Missing** and **Progressing** statuses, its overall health is **Missing**.

## Recognition Rules

**Healthy** status recognition rules for Kubernetes resources: 

| **Resource Type**               | **Status**                                      |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| **Deployment**           | Rolling update completed with all replicas available.  |
| **StatefulSet**          | Update completed with all pods ready.       |
| **ReplicaSet**           | All Pods healthy.             |
| **DaemonSet**            | Desired number of Pods scheduled and healthy.  |
| **Ingress**              | LoadBalancer IP/hostname populated in status.  |
| **Service**              | LoadBalancer IP/hostname populated (if applicable).  |
| **PVC**                  | Status is **Bound**.                      |
| **Pod**                  | All containers ready with no restarts exceeding thresholds.    |
| **Job**                  | Job completed successfully (`.status.succeeded >= 1`).   |
| **HPA**                  | Successful scaling operation with current replicas matching desired count.  |
