# GitOps

## Introduction

GitOps is the practice of using a Git repository as the authoritative source for infrastructure and application configurations. All operational changes are version-controlled, automated, and auditable through Git. It relies on declarative configurations stored in Git, where any modifications must be committed to trigger automated deployment processes.

## Core Principles

- **Declarative Configuration**: GitOps fundamentally requires declarative tools, treating Git as the single source of truth. This enables consistent application deployment across Kubernetes clusters and platform-agnostic recovery in case of failures.
- **Versioned & Immutable State**: Infrastructure and application versions are directly mapped to Git commits. Rollbacks are executed via `git revert`, ensuring immutable version history.
- **Automated Reconciliation**: Merged declarative states are automatically applied to clusters. This eliminates manual intervention, prevents human errors, and supports security approvals in deployment workflows.
- **Self-Healing**: Controllers (e.g., Argo CD) continuously reconcile cluster states with Git-defined states, enabling autonomous system recovery.

## Advantages \{#gitops-advantage}

- **Accelerated Collaboration & Delivery**: Declarative definitions of infrastructure, configurations, and target states stored in Git enable automated deployments. Teams achieve one-click environment provisioning post-validation, streamlining collaboration and delivery.
- **Rapid Rollback & Recovery**: Leveraging Git's version control, anomalies trigger instant rollbacks. GitOps controllers ensure self-healing through automated reconciliation.
- **Multi-Environment Governance**: Git as the single source of truth, combined with configuration overlays, enables precise bulk deployments across hybrid/multi-cloud environments.
- **Enhanced Security & Compliance**: Git's RBAC, audit logs, branch protections, and encryption secure sensitive configurations, ensuring compliance.

## Popular GitOps Tools

- **Argo CD**: A Kubernetes-native declarative GitOps tool for defining, versioning, and automating application lifecycles with auditability.
- **Flux**: A lightweight Kubernetes GitOps operator that continuously syncs Git repositories to clusters.
- **Jenkins X**: A CI/CD platform with GitOps integration for automated pipelines and Git-driven deployments.
